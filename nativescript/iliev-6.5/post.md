## Dynamic Creation of Tabs and Bottom Navigation

The `Tabs` and `BottomNavigation` components were introduced as beta components in NativeScript 6.1. With this release, both components are further expanding their functionality by providing means for creating them programmatically.

To support the dynamic creation of the components, two new properties were introduced as part of the `TabStrip` sub-component. The first is the `iconSource` which is used to programmatically create the `TabStrip` icon (supporting a resource file via `res://`, local file via `~/`, and icon font via `font://`). The second property is called `iconClass` and its purpose is to set the CSS class that will be applied to the icon (a must if you want to use an icon font with `font://`).

Example for dynamic creation of `Tabs`

	let tabs = new Tabs();
	let myTabStrip = new TabStrip();
	
	let tabStripItem1 = new TabStripItem();
	tabStripItem1.title = "Tab 1";
	tabStripItem1.iconSource = `font://${String.fromCharCode(0xf053)}`;
	tabStripItem1.iconClass = "fas"; // e.g., Font Awesome
	let tabStripItem2 = new TabStripItem();
	tabStripItem2.title = "Tab 2";
	tabStripItem2.iconSource = `font://${String.fromCharCode(0xf070)}`;
	tabStripItem2.iconClass = "fas"; // e.g., Font Awesome
	
	myTabStrip.items = [tabStripItem1, tabStripItem2];
	
	let tabContentItem1 = new TabContentItem();
	tabContentItem1.content = createContent("Content 1");
	let tabContentItem2 = new TabContentItem();
	tabContentItem2.content = createContent("Content 2");
	
	let contentItems = [tabContentItem1, tabContentItem2];   
	
	tabs.tabStrip = myTabStrip;
	
	// Note: The number of content items must be equal to the number of strip items
	tabs.items = contentItems;

## New Styling Properties in TabStrip

We are introducing two new properties for the `TabStrip` component: **selectedItemColor** and **unSelectedItemColor**. The reason to introduce these properties is to have the ability to easily modify the color of `TabStrip` items' icon and text. Doing this also follows the **Material Design Guidelines** for having the icon and text color be the same.

Using these new properties is quite easy. Suppose we have a simple `Tabs` component and we want to make the `selectedItemColor` red and the `unSelectedItemColor` green:

	<Tabs selectedIndex="1">
	    <TabStrip selectedItemColor="red" unSelectedItemColor="green">
	            ...
	    </TabStrip>
	</Tabs>

When we build our app we will observe that the icon and the text now have the specified colors we set in the markup:

## Advanced iOS Styling Options in Tabs

Prior to version 6.5, the `Tabs` component had limited styling possibilities for iOS. Now the iOS styling options are expanded greatly by providing a property for tab strip alignment and also by providing options to apply extended CSS styling.

To change the alignment for `TabStrip`, set the **iOSTabBarItemsAlignment** property of the **Tabs** component.

	<!-- justify is now the defealt value for iOSTabBarItemsAlignment property -->
	<Tabs iOSTabBarItemsAlignment="justify">

*The new property supports the following values:*

`leading` : tab items are aligned to the left

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mrbtm7K.png" alt="example for using leading value" style="width:40%;;box-shadow: 0 0 15px #000"/>

`justified` : tab strip is split equally to all the tab items

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vELDcfY.png" alt="example for using justified value" style="width:40%;;box-shadow: 0 0 15px #000"/>

`center` : tabs items are aligned in the center

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GGnaI0j.png" alt="example for using center value" style="width:40%;;box-shadow: 0 0 15px #000"/>

`centerSelected` : tab items move to make the selected tab in the center

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tLzO5wK.png" alt="example for using centerSelected value" style="width:40%;;box-shadow: 0 0 15px #000"/>

The above property now provide means for changing the `font`, `background-color`, `color`, and `TextTransform`. Note that there are some limitations:

- The iOS `MDCTabBar` supports only two styles of the tab strip items - `normal` and `selected`, which means that you cannot have different styles for two items with the same normal state.
- The supported `TextTransform` values for the `TabStrip` are `none`, `initial` and `uppercase`.
- If the `iOSTabBarItemsAlignment` is set to something different than `justify` and you want to set the background of the selected item, you can achieve it by setting `:active` style to the `TabStrip` item, but the selection highlight indicator will not be shown in that case.

## DoubleTapGestureEventData 

A community-driven PR (thank you [MCurran16](https://github.com/MCurran16)!) has extended the double-tap event data which up until now was of a generic type (`GestureEventData`). The newly introduced `DoubleTapGestureEventData` extends the common data by providing two methods for accessing the coordinates of the triggered double tap event. The methods are `getX()` and `getY()` and as expected they will return X and Y coordinates for the current interaction. Ð¢he values are in device pixels based on the specific platform coordinate system.

## Experimental KotlinJS Support

With this release we continue our support for Kotlin but this time on the front end side of app development. We are introducing *experimental* support for writing NativeScript applications with [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html).

We must say that this is highly experimental and subject to change but nevertheless, we would be happy for the community to take a look at the [HelloWorld sample with KotlinJS](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates/blob/experimental/packages/template-hello-world-kt/README.md). Please, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to use it. Additional documentation will follow in the near future!
