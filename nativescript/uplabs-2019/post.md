# The NativeScript Challenge on Uplabs is Back! ðŸ¥Š

Last year, NativeScript partnered with Uplabs to invite mobile app developers and designers to collaborate on simple, but engaging, apps to showcase the ease of development and power of {N}. We couldn't have been more pleased with the apps you created!

**And we're back with another challenge!**

If you're new here, [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/) is a popular community of designers and developers who create gorgeous app concepts and mockups on everything from a [Netflix redesign](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/netflix-redesign-challenge/results) to screens with [nothing to show](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/empty-states-challenge/results).

This NativeScript/Uplabs challenge involves using the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/) to create a small-ish app (e.g. 1-5 pages/views) that works equally well on both iOS and Android.

There is **no specific theme** so the world is your oyster with this challenge! If you need some ideas, you should consider an app that:

- Provides a digital assistant or chatbot UI ðŸ¤–
- Shows off how an insurance company might handle a claim ðŸš—ðŸ’¥
- Gives bank ðŸ’° or credit card ðŸ’³ companies fun and a new ways to engage their users

You can also display the weather, use some fancy charts/graphs, create some cool data entry forms, build the next great housing/hotel app...anything that looks good on a mobile device.

Oh, did we mention there are significant cash prizes?! ðŸ¤‘

> Intimidated by the thought of trying to create a "gorgeous" app? Have no fear! You can [request a partner](https://forms.gle/XTp6GnGzaBRK3WZB6) and we will do our best to hook up NativeScript developers with designers from Uplabs!
