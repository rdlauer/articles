# Webinar: NativeScript on Fire(base) ðŸ”¥

While NativeScript is a proven option for creating an engaging frontend of your iOS and Android app, what about the backend?

Over the years youâ€™ve shown us that [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is THE preferred mobile Backend-as-a-Service (mBaaS) of NativeScript developers. With enticing features, reliability, and low pricing for small/medium sized apps, Firebase can be an easy choice. Combine it with a [robust NativeScript plugin](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-plugin-firebase), and, well, it doesnâ€™t get much more simple!

From machine learning with ML Kit, to crash metrics with Crashlytics, to performance monitoring, to analytics, and on and on, Firebase has a lot to offer the NativeScript developer.
