# Join the NativeScript 6.0 Launch Webinar

NativeScript 6.0 represents a quantum leap for JavaScript-native app development. For years weâ€™ve seen how web developers can become native mobile app developers overnight, using skills honed over the years to create increasingly more engaging mobile experiences for iOS and Android.

But "mobility" as we once knew it is evolving. Today weâ€™re adding new mobile experiences like [chatbots](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/chat) and [augmented reality](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/getting-started-with-augmented-reality-in-nativescript) and new platforms like Apple Watch and Android Wear, using your framework of choice - Angular or Vue.js (and even [React](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-nativescript) or [Svelte](https://svelte-native.technology/) ðŸ¤¯).

**NativeScript 6.0 is where it all comes together.**
