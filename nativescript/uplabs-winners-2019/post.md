# Your NativeScript UpLabs Challenge Winners

Recently NativeScript and UpLabs [collaborated on a "challenge"](https://www.uplabs.com/challenges/nativescript-uplabs-challenge-ac5fdcca-4e29-4e12-aa3d-0924424bdae7) to inspire designers and developers to collaborate on building engaging apps with NativeScript (and the [NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/)).

We received some great submissions, the community voted, and now it's time to award some prizes! üéÅ

## $2,000 NativeScript Team Prizes

The first prize was awarded via an internal vote of folks on the NativeScript team. **And once again this year we ended with a split decision!**

*We are pleased to award a $1,000 prize to each of the two following challengers:*

[Aderounmu Bamgbose](https://www.uplabs.com/aderounmubamgbose) built a fantastic [Cinema Concept App](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/cinema-concept-app) using NativeScript and Vue.js:
