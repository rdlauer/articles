## iOS 8 Support in the Telerik Platform

While it's fun to see the latest mobile gadgets that come tumbling out of Cupertino, the core of Apple's mobile strategy revolves around iOS - and of course Telerik is there to support the latest and greatest on day one. With iOS 8 (and the Apple Watch), Apple continues to produce innovative mobile hardware and push the envelope with what can be done with their platform. While not a dramatic change from a UI perspective, iOS 8 brings with it amazing opportunities for hybrid mobile developers and a host of new features for us to tap into. The question today is, what does this mean to AppBuilder and the Telerik Platform?

### We Support iOS 8 Today

First and foremost, iOS apps built with AppBuilder today will run fine on iOS 8 with absolutely no changes needed to the code. And to take advantage of this support, you need to do perform the following steps:

1. Nothing :)

**Remember, with Telerik AppBuilder we handle everything for you in the cloud** - you don't have to download and manage the latest version of Xcode, iOS SDKs, or the iOS Simulator. Everything you need to support iOS 8 is available for you as part of AppBuilder.

Elsewhere in the Telerik Platform, [Mobile Testing](http://www.telerik.com/mobile-testing) has also been updated to support iOS 8, but that's not the end of our iOS 8 story, not by a long shot.

### Building On Our iOS 8 Support

In an upcoming [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform) release, we will expand our iOS 8 support into areas such as:

- Simulator support for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+, along with the ability to simulate new pixel density ratios.
- Support for the new [WKWebView](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/why-ios-8s-wkwebview-is-a-big-deal-for-hybrid-development/), which promises up to 4x the JavaScript execution speed.
- Kendo UI updates to support the latest features and designs introduced with iOS 8.
- Updated support for the latest Cordova bits featuring iOS 8 improvements.

*And we promise that your experience with the Telerik Platform and iOS 8 will be far less awkward than Tim Cook touching fingers with Bono.*
