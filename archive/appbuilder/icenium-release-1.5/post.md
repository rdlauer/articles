### <a id="dataviz"></a>Kendo UI DataViz Integration

![kendo ui dataviz](dataviz.png)

Any [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com/) fans out there? I know there are, which is why we have now included a [Kendo UI DataViz](http://www.kendoui.com/dataviz.aspx) starter template! For those of you who haven't heard of Kendo UI DataViz, it is an HTML5-based charting system that allows you to develop amazing charts, dashboards, and other data visualizations. Kendo UI DataViz fully supports mobile browsers, which makes it an obvious choice for data-rich hybrid mobile apps. Kendo UI DataViz is included with the [Professional](http://www.icenium.com/pricing) and [Ultimate](http://www.icenium.com/pricing) accounts (see the "Pricing Details" section below for more information on our new pricing plans).

### <a id="support"></a>Dedicated Support and Updated Documentation

We are proud to announce the availability of dedicated support for Icenium! Developer support has always been a proud tradition of Telerik and our support for Icenium is no different. With a [Professional](http://www.icenium.com/pricing) or [Ultimate](http://www.icenium.com/pricing) account you will now have access to our personal support ticket system (with turnaround times of 24-48 hours). In addition, we still have the [Icenium Forums](http://www.icenium.com/community/forums) that are free for everyone to use.

We are also excited about our completely revamped documentation! The entire [Icenium Docs](http://docs.icenium.com/) site has been updated to include new tutorials, a more intuitive navigation scheme, and updates to existing content. Our docs will always be a work in progress as we continually strive to improve our online documentation.

### <a id="pricing"></a>Pricing Details Released

The next time you log into Icenium your account will be automatically transferred to a 30-day trial of Icenium Ultimate. During this trial period you will be able to choose one of our new annual or monthly subscription offerings. Have no fear - if your free trial expires, your code will still be available for you to download at any time. Take a look at our [new pricing plans](http://www.icenium.com/pricing) which start at $16/month.

### <a id="general"></a>General Icenium Updates and Fixes

#### PushPlugin Updated

![cordova pushplugin](pushplugin.gif)

There were some significant bugs in the previous version of PushPlugin, so we made it a priority to get this new version out to you as soon as possible. If you haven't used PushPlugin yet, it's a Cordova plugin that allows you to send push notifications to your iOS and Android users. There is a [nice tutorial](http://www.icenium.com/community/blog/icenium-team-blog/2013/04/17/push-notifications-with-cordova-icenium) on the Icenium blogs as well.

### <a id="everlive"></a>Icenium Everlive Preview

[![icenium everlive](cloud.png)](http://visualpharm.com)

Last, but certainly not least, is the integration of **Icenium Everlive Cloud Services**. Icenium Everlive is a  Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution that helps you to create hybrid mobile apps that consume cloud-based services. At a very high level, Icenium Everlive helps you with things like user management, data storage (database in the cloud!), server-side cloud code (server-side data validation!), and email notifications.

Icenium Everlive provides you with [RESTful services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_APIs) to consume all of your custom objects (you may consider these your "database tables in the cloud"). In addition, the comprehensive built-in user management allows you to manage users and apply user-level permissions to these custom objects. Icenium Everlive also **allows for file storage** so you can store BLOB-type data in your custom objects (like video files, images, and other large documents). More information about Icenium Everlive can be found [here](http://www.icenium.com/product/everlive).

Icenium Everlive is a very exciting addition and we look forward to talking to you more about this service through future blog posts and tutorials. In the meantime, enjoy the preview and continue to [send us feedback](http://feedback.telerik.com/Project/87)!

### Conclusion

I sincerely hope you enjoy the latest updates to Icenium. Our team has listened to your feedback and has worked hard to respond to your requests - and will continue to do so for each upcoming release!
