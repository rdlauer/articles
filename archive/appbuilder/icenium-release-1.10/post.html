<h3 id="mist">A New Look For Mist</h3>

<p><a href="https://app.icenium.com/Mist/">Icenium Mist</a>, our cloud based development suite has been redesigned from the ground up for a cleaner look and an improved user experience.</p>

<p>All menus, popup messages, dialogs, and wizards have been reworked to provide more context-sensitive information to help you complete tasks. For instance the build dialog now gives you additional help text on the various build options Icenium provides.</p>

<p>We'd love to hear your thoughts on the new look and whether there's anything else we can do to improve.</p>

<h3 id="cordova">Support for Apache Cordova 3.2</h3>

<p>Apache Cordova released version 3.2 in late November with a <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2013/11/22/cordova-320.html">number of bug fixes and enhancements</a> - including one for the dreaded <a href="/blog/icenium-team-blog/2013/11/07/everything-hybrid-web-apps-need-to-know-about-the-status-bar-in-ios7">status bar in iOS7</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.icenium.com/iceniumImages/default-source/blog-images/apache-cordova-logo.png?sfvrsn=2" alt="Cordova icon"></p>

<p>All Icenium project templates and sample applications have been updated to target Apache Cordova 3.2. To update your existing projects go to its project properties shown below.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.icenium.com/iceniumImages/default-source/blog-images/1-10-upgrade-1.png?sfvrsn=2" alt="Screenshot of project properties menu"></p>

<p>Then update the "Cordova Version" accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Note: To get to the same dialog in Visual Studio right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Properties".</em></p>

<p>In addition to this, Icenium now comes with integrated support for the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/blob/master/statusbar/README.md">StatusBar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/blob/master/keyboard/README.md">Keyboard</a> plugins for iOS.</p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-extension">Updated Visual Studio Extension</h3>

<p>Out latest release also brings a number of enhancements to Icenium's extension for Visual Studio, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Support for on-device debugging of iOS apps.</strong><br>For devices that run iOS6 or later, and apps that have a provisioning profile for iOS development, you can now do on-device debugging directly within Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Improved support for the connection API in the device simulator.</strong><br>Within Visual Studio's simulator, setting the connection type to <em>None</em> now disables all network requests - perfect for testing the offline capabilities of your apps. <img src="http://www.icenium.com/iceniumImages/default-source/blog-images/1-10-vs-connection.png?sfvrsn=2" alt="Screenshot showing the connection option in Visual Studio's simulator"></li>
<li><strong>Improved build process</strong><br>To help debug potential issues, the Icenium Extension for Visual Studio now uploads temporary build data. You can remove this data at any time by selecting <strong>Icenium -> Remove <project name> Data from Cloud</strong> in the menu bar.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ui-mobile">Improved UI Mobile Designer</h3>

<p>Finally, this release adds a number of powerful new features to our UI Mobile Designer in Mist and Graphite.</p>

<p>From within the UI Mobile Designer, you can now switch between tablet and phone simulators, switch iOS versions, and even change the device orientation between portrait and landscape.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.icenium.com/iceniumImages/default-source/blog-images/1-10-designer.gif?sfvrsn=2" alt="Showing off the tablet and portrait/landscape tools in the designer"></p>

<p>We've also made the UI designer easier to use with an integrated widget filter and some context sensitive help that links to <a href="http://docs.kendoui.com/api/mobile/">Kendo UI Mobile's API documentation</a> appropriately. You can see these new enhancements below.</p>
