## The Verified Cordova Plugins Marketplace Wants YOU

A few months ago we released the [Verified Plugins Marketplace](http://plugins.telerik.com/), a trusted source of Cordova/PhoneGap plugins for hybrid mobile developers. Since then we have been growing the marketplace steadily, adding new community plugins, plugins from some of our trusted partners, and even some we created in-house. **And next up is you! We are proud to announce the opening of our marketplace to all Cordova plugin developers!**

Let's first take a moment to look at some of the highlights from our first few months:

### Highlights

We seeded the Verified Plugins Marketplace with about a dozen plugins, and now we are up to more than thirty (and growing). We have seen some of the biggest impact come from the most unlikely of Cordova plugins (such as the [Flashlight](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/flashlight) plugin). We've also seen developers flock to the [Calendar](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/calendar), [SocialSharing](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/socialsharing), [EmailComposer](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/emailcomposer), and [AdMob](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/admob) plugins - all high value plugins that are easy to integrate with your apps.

**We have been lucky to work with some great third party services and partners recently, such as:**

- [Dropbox](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/dropbox)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/amazon-aws)
- [SendGrid](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/sendgrid)
- [Crittercism](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/crittercism)
- [Couchbase](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/couchbase-lite)
- [LeanPlum](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/leanplum)
- [AYLIEN](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/aylien-text-analysis-api)

Not only that, but we have started including a variety of high value Cordova/PhoneGap plugins from some big industry names like [PayPal](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/paypal) and [Stripe](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/stripe) to handle in-app financial transactions.

### Telerik's Own

![telerik created plugins](telerik_branded_plugin.png)

We provide the Verified Plugins Marketplace as a resource for ALL Cordova/PhoneGap mobile app developers (regardless of whether or not they also use [Telerik AppBuilder](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder)). We also want to contribute directly to the community by providing our own home-grown plugins.

Soon you'll be able to access some of our [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform) services though Cordova plugins, such as [Analytics](http://www.telerik.com/analytics), [Mobile Testing](http://www.telerik.com/mobile-testing), and [AppFeedback](http://www.telerik.com/appfeedback)!

### Focus on Hybrid App Performance

We recently released a new version of our [Native Page Transitions](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/native-page-transitions) plugin. **This is an exciting new opportunity for developers to make their hybrid apps FEEL more like native apps by increasing the speed and fluidity of page transitions.**

> Tip: We also quietly released a drop-in [Native Page Transitions adapter for Kendo UI](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/NativePageTransitions/blob/master/adapters/NativePageTransitionsKendoAdapter.js), which automatically converts your existing Kendo UI transitions to native by just dropping in a JavaScript file!

Next up is a brand new plugin for iOS that allows you to take advantage of the performance improvements in the [iOS 8 WKWebView](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/why-ios-8s-wkwebview-is-a-big-deal-for-hybrid-development/). Look for this plugin to show up in the coming weeks! (Speaking of iOS 8, we also have a [HealthKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/) plugin for Cordova nearly ready for release as well.)

### Calling All Plugin Developers

It's always great to see a community growing and building a resource like this, so now is the right time to take the next step and open up the Verified Plugins Marketplace to all Cordova plugin developers. **THIS MEANS YOU!**

**Starting today you can [apply to be part of our marketplace](http://plugins.telerik.com/submit).** Have you created a Cordova plugin? Do you think this plugin provides value for hybrid developers (even if it is an edge case)? If so, [apply today](http://plugins.telerik.com/submit) and we'll make sure you have the opportunity to publish and market your plugin on the marketplace.

And of course, it's free to join and free to publish!

### What's Next?

You'll be seeing more and more Cordova/PhoneGap plugins added to the [Verified Plugins Marketplace](http://plugins.telerik.com/) through the end of the year and into 2015. Remember to [suggest a plugin](http://telerik-verified-plugins.uservoice.com/forums/258510-plugin-ideas) if you feel like something is missing or build your own plugin and join the marketplace yourself!
