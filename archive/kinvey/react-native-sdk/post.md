# The React Native SDK for Kinvey is Now Available

[Progress Kinvey](https://www.progress.com/kinvey) has enabled numerous developers over the years to modernize (and mobilize) their data. But Kinvey is much more than *just* data. With [chatbots](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/chat) powering mobile UI, enterprise user authentication/authorization, cloud functions, and unparalleled security options, Kinvey is positioned as a leading cloud-based app development platform.

Kinvey is also well known for its [extensive SDKs](https://devcenter.kinvey.com). Instead of providing just the "lowest common denominator" of SDKs, Kinvey includes built-in support for:

- iOS
- Android
- NativeScript
- HTML5
- REST
- Xamarin
- Angular
- PhoneGap/Cordova
- Node.js
- .NET

But one SDK has been suspiciously missing...

## Introducing the React Native SDK

We are pleased to announce the availability of the [React Native SDK for Kinvey](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/tree/master/packages/react-native-sdk). Frontend developers who develop mobile apps with JavaScript have many options today (including Progress's own [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)). React Native is another popular option, and now Kinvey provides full support.

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) has become wildly popular amongst the growing React community. You can build and deploy native mobile apps for iOS and Android, all using your favorite framework (React) and language (JavaScript).
