# Microapps - the Secure and Compliant App Option for the Enterprise

Let there be no doubt that today's IT landscape starts with security. From data leaks in unpatched legacy systems, to phishing attacks, to intricate hacking threats, to ??? - the threat and impact of security-related events is not in question.

So it's up to us as app developers, architects, and other IT decision-makers to make sure we are A) securing the assets we have, and B) reducing the footprint of potential future attacks.

Simultaneously, an issue experienced more and more frequently by mid to large enterprises is "app sprawl". App sprawl is the concept of one entity or business being responsible for development, maintenance, and deployment of multiple individual apps. These apps tend to work independently of each other, without relation in function, but *with* access to shared data, shared HR systems, and shared role-based access.

App sprawl leads to an app maintenance nightmare. Which in turn can lead to increased security risks as we struggle to maintain an ever-growing set of apps deployed in the field.

Then you factor in compliance regulations (e.g. for those in the healthcare field or government) and efficient onboarding/offboarding processes to guarantee that new employees have immediate access to the resources we need and that expired employees *don't* have access to the resources they no longer need.

To put it simply: "Yikes".

This wouldn't be a responsible article if we didn't at least attempt to identify some possible solutions (or at least ways of mitigating the problems). So let's start with one piece of the puzzle: microapps.

## What Makes Microapps More Secure?

This is the real question, isn't it? When adopting a new means of developing and deploying apps, it better be worth the effort!

First of all, let me stop you (actually myself) right there. A well-designed microapps platform *doesn't require you to fundamentally change the way you develop apps*. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you should be able to drop existing web apps into a microapp container and easily create new apps either from scratch using proven open source methodologies, or even create new experiences from pre-built templates.

But I digress.

A microapps strategy is fundamentally more secure than the traditional means of app development and deployment, primarily because it lowers your exposed footprint. Instead of managing multiple apps (and maintaining and deploying) you are usually only managing *one single container app*.

This single container app can have *n* number of microapps within it (as explained above). Each microapps is then provisioned to employees using existing role-based provisioning options provided by such protocols as Active Directory.

> A proper microapps platform lets you re-use existing identity management systems *and* existing apps.

### Compliance

Then there is compliance. If you are in an industry that requires compliance with one of any number of security considerations (like HIPAA, SOC2, ???, or ???), then compliance is also at the top of your list.

Again, a proper microapps platform will offer built-in compliance offerings, taking the burden (and responsibility) off of your dev team on placing that firmly in the hands of the provider.
