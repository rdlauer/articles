Security  

Another potential vector for security issues 

Securing data at rest, and in transport 

Connectivity to existing enterprise and legacy apps 

Chatbots that integrate with existing systems can be made to perform tasks, and read/write data in different systems 

Chatbots that have connectivity and integrations out of the box lower the cost of development 

Sequential chatbots versus contextual chatbots 

Sequential Chatbots are like a phone menu. The exact combination of things must be entered in exactly the right way in order to produce the desired result 

Contextual chatbots can gather the appropriate info needed to perform a task, regardless of the sequence it was entered in 

Training Chatbots 

Manual versus Machine Learning 

Making your chatbot more “human” 

Variety of responses available (“Got it”, “Ok, makes sense”, “Perfect”) 

Conversational workflow (not sequential) 

Deployment 

Facebook, Viber, Web, Mobile, etc
