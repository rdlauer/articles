# The Future of HTTP Debugging with Fiddler Everywhere

The vast majority of web, desktop, and mobile apps built today utilize remote services and/or data stores accessed via HTTP/S protocols. In some fortunate cases, these remote APIs are rock solid, meaning the API is perfectly documented and communication to/from the endpoint works as expected and without fail. But thatâ€™s not a reality most app developers live in.

As the world moves towards more complex app development needs, APIs maintain a similar pace. APIs become simultaneously more powerful and more complex, inviting numerous opportunities for failures. Therefore, the need to both inspect and debug these APIs will only increase over time. To accomplish this, there are few tools in the market today that are more used and more established than Progress Telerik Fiddler.

Fiddler has been used by countless enterprises and individual developers for more than fifteen years. Initially developed by Eric Lawrence while working on the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft, Fiddler was later acquired by the UI component vendor, Telerik, in 2012. Following the acquisition of Telerik by Progress, Fiddler has maintained its reputation as the go-to tool for network traffic inspection and debugging amongst its many fans.

Times change and the needs of app developers are rapidly changing as well. New client-side frameworks are being used, apps are developed on new platforms, and the bar for user experience of developer tooling is ever-rising. This is why Progress is investing in the next generation of Fiddler tooling: Fiddler Everywhere. Fiddler Everywhere is a new, cross-platform, version of Fiddler that provides a focused and engaging user experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.
