# Debugging with Fiddler Everywhere: Scanning for 404 and 500 Status Codes

[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) has proven itself as a trusted Windows-based tool for diagnosing and debugging network issues for both web and desktop apps. And you may have heard about this [Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere) thing - it's the start of a new generation of Fiddler tooling that shares the same core engine, but with a modern UI, improved user experience, and fully enabled across macOS, Windows, and Linux!

> Speaking of new Fiddler tooling - take a peak at [Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam) if you're interested in inspecting remote customer issues!

In this blog series, we are looking at a variety of real world scenarios that can be effectively addressed with Fiddler Everywhere. Today we are going to look into how to scan for "silent" 404 and 500 errors that may otherwise be missed during app development and testing.

## Our Scenario: Scanning for 404/500 Errors

As a developer, I'm responsible for maintaining a stable of web applications for my company. One of them in particular is <s>an ancient app</s> a well-loved app, it's pretty massive and I'd like to scan for any potential 404 or 500 errors that may not be immediately visible when casually using the app. The "silent killer" of legacy apps! 🗡️

Maybe a background service is throwing a 500 error that isn't immediately evident. There could be some missing images throwing 404s that don't yet interrupt my UI. Even a process running on a worker thread that silently errors out, but doesn't impact the app directly, could be a problem.

In all of these situations, and more, we can see how quickly Fiddler Everywhere can help us by quickly **filtering and inspecting all of the network traffic** to and from my app.

## Fiddler Everywhere's Solution

Since Fiddler Everywhere intercepts *literally* every network request coming/going to/from your apps (over both HTTP and HTTPS), it's actually quite easy for us to track all of our network sessions and quickly sniff-out any erroneous requests.

*Let's try it out:*

**1)** Open Fiddler Everywhere and toggle the **Live Traffic** option to **Capturing**:

**2)** Open the web or desktop app you are working with - and use it as you normally would to test out all of your user scenarios.

**3)** Back in Fiddler Everywhere, toggle the **Live Traffic** option to **Paused** so as to limit new sessions coming into our UI and reduce the clutter.

**4)** Before we start scanning the (likely) ridiculous number of network requests we see, let's first **filter our requests** by URL request(s) of the app. This way you'll only see sessions that are relevant to the app we care about.

> **NOTE:** If you are debugging a desktop app, you can also filter this view by *process*.

**5)** We can then add another filter in the **Result** column to only display 404 or 500 status codes.

**6)** Find any culprits? Just double-click on that particular request to view the details, fix the problem, and test again!

Easy! 🎉

## Summary

Fiddler Everywhere can help us diagnose and resolve many different types of issues we commonly run into. Today we took a look at scanning for status codes that might interrupt our app's performance or usability. The capabilities of Fiddler Everywhere allow us to address numerous other scenarios, allowing us to quickly resolve them before our customers complain 😅.
