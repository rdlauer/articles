### Questions (and Answers)

We had A LOT of engaged users asking A LOT of fantastic questions during the webinar. After pouring over them, we have a relatively short list of just some of the questions to share:

*Getting Started*

**Amazing tools - how might I, who has never used any Telerik tools, learn how to use them?** Simply [start your Telerik Platform trial](https://platform.telerik.com/) today - as soon as you join we provide you the opportunity to experience our tools with a variety of "quick start" tutorials.

*NativeScript*

**What is the performance of the app generated by [NativeScript](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript) vs real native apps?** The performance is almost the same as a real native app. Actually it is impossible to figure out that an app is built with NativeScript. You can go to the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript/id882561588?mt=8) and search for NativeScript. This is our companion app that is built with NativeScript and hosts a simple app that you can try out.

**How do I apply for the beta for NativeScript?** [www.telerik.com/nativescript](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript)

*Mobile Testing/Device Cloud*

**When will device cloud be available?** December 16th. Start writing those tests now!

**Are the "cloud devices" for testing using VMs or are they scripted against physical devices?** Physical devices.

**How does the platform work with a GIT repository and automatic testing?**	Telerik Platform plays very well when comes to Git repositories. There is even out of the box support for connecting your projects with some git providers. As for automatic testing you can check out [Telerik Mobile Testing](http://www.telerik.com/mobile-testing).

*Backend Services*

**In regards to [responsive images](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/responsive-images-theres-service/): What is the expected data saved?** The idea is that you can get your image re-sized to any resolution you need. It is re-sized on our servers and then returned to you. We do support CDN as well. We have a JavaScript client library that automatically requests the right size of image for the device. It can be used both on web sites and hybrid mobile apps.

*AppBuilder*

**What about the native features? Does AppBuilder have common code or we will have to code for every platform?** When you develop a hybrid app with AppBuilder you are writing one code base for all three major mobile platforms (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8). We are using the Cordova framework which uses plugins written in the mobile platform native frameworks to deliver cross-platform features.

**The landscape for displays is changing. Phone screens are getting larger. Tablet screens are getting smaller. Soon screen shapes will be changing. What is Telerik doing to prepare for screen shape changes and allow developers to take advantage of these changes as they emerge?** Wearables are a big part of our strategy for 2015 - rest assured we are preparing for the latest in wearables and IoT across all of our supported platforms.

*Verified Plugins Marketplace*

**Are the plugins provided by Telerik checked that they don't contain malware or other fraud?** The plugins offered on [plugins.telerik.com](http://plugins.telerik.com/) are indeed verified for malicious behavior and we strive to fix any bugs encountered in them.

**Will there be a easy way/plugin to monetize your app?** Absolutely, try out the Verified Plugins Marketplace and the [AdMob plugin](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/admob).

*General*

**What are you using to mirror your iPhone on screen?**	It is the Reflector app. More info here: [developer.telerik.com/featured/mirroring-options-mobile-developers](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/mirroring-options-mobile-developers/)

**We've used AppForge in the past and when that company went bankrupt, we were left with apps that we could no longer deploy because we no longer could get device licenses. If Telerik went under (of course, you won't) would we have this same issue?** No! When you use the Telerik Platform there is no vendor lock-in whatsoever. Even if your subscription runs out, you'll still have access to your projects.

**Is Telerik moving away from .Net development and support?** No! .NET is here to stay. We are just expanding to new horizons.
