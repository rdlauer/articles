## Telerik Platform Webinar Recap - Mobile App Development, Demystified

[![mobile app development webinar](sep-webinar-guy.jpg)](http://www.telerik.com/webinars/appbuilder/mobile-application-development-demystified)

Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a webinar that focused on quickly and easily building a cross-platform mobile app with [Telerik Platform by Progress](http://www.telerik.com/platform). The webinar's target audience was, frankly, any developer who is new to mobile app development and unsure where to begin. For example:

- **Web developers** who know HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, but don't know how to migrate these skills to mobile app development.
- **.NET developers** who do WPF, WinForms, or ASP.NET development, but also haven't found an easy way leverage these skills in the mobile app world.
- **JavaScript developers** who love the language, but don't want to learn Objective-C, Swift, or Java, just to create a native mobile app.

**We also discussed the fact that mobile development is really about creating a mobile experience for your users.** This could mean solutions such as:

- A responsive mobile website created with [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui).
- A hybrid mobile app created with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and Kendo UI or Ionic.
- A native mobile app created with JavaScript and [Telerik NativeScript](http://www.nativescript.org/).

During the live demo, I used the Telerik Platform to quickly create a native mobile app without any code at all!

If you'd like to watch the webinar for the first time and/or follow along with the 15 minute demo using a [free 30 day Telerik Platform trial](https://platform.telerik.com), feel free to do so:
