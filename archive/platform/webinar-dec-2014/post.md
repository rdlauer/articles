It's hard to believe that it has already been four months since our [last Telerik Platform webinar](http://www.telerik.com/webinars/appbuilder/telerik-platform-supercharging-mobile-app-development). Back in July we showed off many great features of the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform) that make your mobile app development experience faster, easier, and more productive. Since that time we have only increased our velocity to continue to provide you the best end-to-end mobile app development platform!

And yes, I'm happy to announce the next Telerik Platform webinar which will take place on **December 4th at 11:00 AM EST**. [Register now](http://www.telerik.com/campaigns/platform/december-2014-release) because space is limited (yes, really!). **We will spend an hour going over the very latest features from AppBuilder, Push Notifications, Mobile Testing, Backend Services, and more.** *Of course, we have a couple surprises to show you as well!*

Not only will you learn about the latest and greatest from the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform), but just by attending you will also become eligible to win one of the following fantastic prizes:
