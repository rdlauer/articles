# Telerik Platform Webinar Recap - Modernizing One Hybrid App at a Time

On the off chance you missed the Telerik Platform webinar last week, you missed some great insight into how we are helping to modernize one hybrid app at a time, with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/):

- [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer) explained the differences between Cordova/PhoneGap and NativeScript, and why we are seeing developers flock to native tooling;
- [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper) gave a demo on ways to move beyond Telerik Platform into NativeScript tooling (like [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick));
- [Sebastian Witalec](https://twitter.com/sebawita) showed us how to leverage one code base to create web AND native apps with Angular;
- And Rob was back again showing off the (newly free) premium [NativeScript UI](https://www.nativescript.org/ui-for-nativescript) suite and the [NativeScript Theme Builder](https://www.nativescriptthemebuilder.com/).
