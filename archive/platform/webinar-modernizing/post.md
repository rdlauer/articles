# Modernizing One Hybrid App at a Time - Register for the Free Telerik Platform Webinar

The mobile development landscape has evolved immensely over the last ten years. What used to be limited to native iOS and Android developers is now accessible for hybrid (Cordova) developers and native JavaScript ([NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)) developers.

**And mobility continues to mature!** Telerik Platform once had a laser focus on hybrid app development, but now offers a look at native app development with NativeScript. We know app performance and stability are critical to you, which is why we are helping to modernize mobility, one hybrid app at a time.
