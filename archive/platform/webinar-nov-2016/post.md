[![telerik platform support for angular 2 banner](banner.jpg)](http://www.telerik.com/campaigns/platform/angular-2-support-webinar)

Last week, [Burke Holland](https://twitter.com/burkeholland), [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper), and [Rob Lauer](https://twitter.com/RobLauer) hosted a free webinar focused on how the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform) is addressing the needs of modern developers who want to build native mobile apps with Angular 2. We covered **a lot** in this webinar, including:

- [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)
- [Kendo UI for Angular 2](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/)
- [Telerik UI for NativeScript](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript-ui)
- and of course, Telerik Platform and the Angular 2 framework!

Jen showed off the myriad improvements in Telerik AppBuilder and how you can leverage TypeScript, NativeScript, and Angular 2 to create engaging mobile apps. She also covered some of the latest and greatest from the NativeScript framework itself. Rob showed how to use the Telerik Platform Views service (a.k.a. Screen Builder) to bootstrap your app in a code-free environment.

If you'd like to watch a recording of the webinar and follow along with the presenters using a [free 30 day Telerik Platform trial](https://platform.telerik.com), feel free to do so here:
