# Deep Dive into Telerik Platform Support for Angular 2

If [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) isn't the hottest ticket in town, I don't know what is. Ok maybe [Hamilton](http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com/). But since Angular 2 went final in September, there has been a skyrocketing interest in what the new version of this wildly popular framework brings to the web and mobile developer communities.

For the past few months, the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform) team has been hard at work to make Angular 2 a first class citizen among our tools and services. And we are ready to talk about how **you can leverage Angular 2 to build truly native mobile apps with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)** in a free online webinar on [Tuesday, November 15 at 11:00 AM ET](http://www.telerik.com/campaigns/platform/angular-2-support-webinar).

> Pro tip: We are also giving away great prizes like an Oculus Rift, Xbox One, and a little something from Nintendo that I think you'll like!

## Why Angular 2?

Why are people flocking to Angular 2? Isn't it just another framework? Not at all! Angular 2 is more of a "platform" than a traditional framework - you can use Angular to create responsive websites, hybrid mobile apps, and native mobile apps with NativeScript. All from one code base!

While we will talk a lot about Angular 2 during the webinar, you may want to [read up on some of the benefits](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-is-how-you-build-native-mobile-apps-with-angular) you can take advantage of today. Or even go through an [online tutorial](https://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/ng-chapter-0)!

## Why Telerik Platform?

For years now Telerik Platform has enabled novice and expert developers to create engaging mobile app experiences. By using the power of [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) for hybrid mobile apps, and now NativeScript to create truly native apps, Telerik Platform provides an instantly available environment to code, test, publish, and monitor your app.
