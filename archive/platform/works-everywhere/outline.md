# Building Services That Work in All Apps. No Silos.

This article will build upon James' article on getting started with Backend Services. It'll give a practical example of integrating Backend Services into three different applications: a hybrid web app, a public facing website, and and a backend website. It'll point back to James' article for some of the setup, and build the example to show off the power of services that aren't siloed.

* Intro
	* Define silos in the context of software development.
		* Less flexible to change.
		* Important to be flexible in today's mobile world.
	* Services in the Telerik Platform work everywhere.
