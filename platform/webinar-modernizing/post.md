# Modernizing One Hybrid App at a Time - Register for the Free Telerik Platform Webinar

The mobile development landscape has evolved immensely over the last ten years. What used to be limited to native iOS and Android developers is now accessible for hybrid (Cordova) developers and native JavaScript ([NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)) developers.
