[Chef Desktop](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-desktop) provides IT resource managers the ability to fully automate the deployment and maintenance of laptops and desktops, remotely. It's more than just hardware and software provisioning though, as Chef Desktop also allows for automated compliance scans and issue remediation to help minimize the security risks in an ever-growing remote workforce.

## What Exactly is Chef Desktop?

Chef Desktop allows you to define (in code) management and configuration of your IT resources. If you're familiar with [Chef Infra](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra), then Chef Desktop will feel right at home to you! But if not, don't let the *code* aspect scare you. Chef Desktop includes pre-configured content that enables you to manage your fleet (fully customizable as necessary!). This provides you with immediate value and future flexibility as your fleet evolves.

Just to be clear, Chef Desktop isn't yet another Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. Aside from standard device management capabilities, it enables continuous compliance against [CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) on macOS, Windows, and Linux. In addition, Chef is proud to be the first CIS partner to have our security profiles certified on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform!
