# Begin Your DevSecOps Journey on Learn Chef

For years now, [Learn Chef](https://learn.chef.io/) has been the destination of choice for IT ops practitioners to learn how to expand their DevOps skill sets. Whether it be learning about [securing your infrastructure](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Automate101+Perpetual/about), [managing a fleet of IT resources](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Infra101+perpetual/about), or [delivering applications](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Habitat101+Perpetual/about), Learn Chef has you covered.

But what about folks who are new to DevOps and DevSecOps (not to mention the extensive Chef portfolio)? Diving straight into these topics can be intimidating without the proper context.

This is why we are happy to announce the release of another new course on Learn Chef! [Beginning Your Chef Journey](#).

## So What's in the Course?

This new Learn Chef course was crafted especially for those of you who are new to the Chef portfolio. The course will help you to:

In addition you'll get a brief intro to what DevOps even is, how it relates to DevSecOps, and where Chef fits into this IT operations puzzle. Finally, we provide some insight into **open source at Chef**. Case in point, did you know the following Chef tools are fully open source and comprised of one or more open source projects?

- Chef Infra
- Chef InSpec
- Chef Habitat
- Chef Workstation
- Chef Automate

> You can view all of our open source projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/chef/).

We ‚ù§Ô∏è open source here at Chef and hope you do too!
