# Test Your Chef Knowledge with the Chef Principles Certification

I'm pleased to announce the release of a new Chef-approved certification program: [Chef Principles](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+CP101+exam/about).

This certification exam was built from the ground up to test your knowledge of Chef OSS tools, products, and solutions. It also provides a measuring stick against modern DevOps practices that we encourage within our community.

Best of all, it's available on our expanding [Learn Chef](https://learn.chef.io/) platform (and for free)!

## Imposter Syndrome is Real, But...

If you feel intimidated by starting an exam like this without having what you may think is thorough knowledge of the Chef stack, you should know that the majority of the questions in this exam draw from material already provided at Learn Chef.

While it's not necessary to have "expert-level" knowledge of Chef products and have done a deep dive into all of these Learn Chef courses, we do recommend reviewing these as-necessary:

- [Beginning Your Chef Journey](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Chef101+Perpetual/about)
- [Ruby Essentials](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Ruby101+Perpetual/about) (Coming Soon!)
- [Manage Your Fleet with Chef Infra](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Infra101+perpetual/about)
- [Test Expectations with Chef InSpec](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Inspec101+Perpetual/about)
- [Deliver Applications with Chef Habitat](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Habitat101+Perpetual/about)
- [Chef Compliance: First Steps with Auditing and Remediation](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+SECCOM101+Perpetual/about)
- [Secure Your Infrastructure with Chef Automate](https://learn.chef.io/courses/course-v1:chef+Automate101+Perpetual/about)

It also can't hurt to familiarize yourself with the [Chef docs](https://docs.chef.io/) and use the docs while you're filling out the exam! If you've never looked over the docs, take a moment to familiarize yourself with their structure, and learn how to search the documentation.

> For example, can you locate the default action for the Chef Infra server resource? ðŸ¤”

## Ready to Get Certified?

Before you get started with Chef Principles, you should know that this is a timed exam. You'll have about 90 minutes to complete it in one sitting. If you score less than 70% of the exam (the passing score), you will need to wait about 48 hours to re-take it.

Oh, and the price? We are happily offering Chef Principles for free! Future, more advanced certification exams may require a fee to participate FYI.

If (when!) you pass the exam, you will be awarded with the Chef Principles award (which we encourage you to share on your social networks and with colleagues). The certification will be valid for two years, after which re-certification will be required.

> Reminder: You can always view and share your Learn Chef awards at [badges.chef.io](https://badges.chef.io/auth/login).
