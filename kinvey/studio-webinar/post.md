# Generate Native Mobile Apps, Web Apps, and Chatbots - the Low Code Way

A hallmark of NativeScript development has been its focus on making native mobile app development easier for web developers. We proved this by extending the platform with [Angular](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-is-how-you-build-native-mobile-apps-with-angular) (and shortly thereafter with [Vue.js](https://www.nativescript.org/vue)). More recently, a focus has been on literally *sharing code* between web apps and mobile apps with both Angular- and Vue.js-based code sharing strategies.

Reusing skills and writing *less* code to cover *more* platforms is a clear priority. This includes making developers more productive with the skills and resources have on-hand today. So it's time that our developer tooling caught up!

Let me introduce you to a **new low code tool** from Progress for professional developers we call [Kinvey Studio](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/studio).

But first, let's take a quick trip down memory lane and examine just *how* we got to where we are today.

## Low Code Development: No Longer a Myth

The truth is, "low code" or "no code" tooling has been around for years. Think back (way back) to the days of Netscape Composer and its world-shattering combination of a web browser **with** an HTML editor!

Or what about .NET developers who first got their feet wet with the drag-and-drop canvas provided by Visual Studio?

For many of us, low code tools started as a way to *learn* how to program. Problems arose when we realized the code generated by these tools was, let's just say, an utter disaster.

However, some tools like Dreamweaver worked *with* you, and not against you. Leaving you with mostly human-readable (and editable) code. Providing these "roundtrip" capabilities to go from visual design of WYSIWYG, to raw code, and back again, became a critical part of a realistic workflow.

The days of pure HTML editors are over though, and app development needs are becoming more complex, with more screens needed across unrelated platforms. And today's definition of an "app" oftentimes means:

- a responsive website
- a Progresive Web App
- a native iOS app
- a native Android app
- a cross-platform chatbot
- a wearable on Android Wear OS and/or Apple Watch

With increasing complexity comes an increased need for tooling that can keep up with today's needs. This is where Kinvey Studio comes in.

## Why Kinvey Studio?

If you're looking for an elevator pitch for Kinvey Studio, it goes something like this:

*"Kinvey Studio enables professional developers to build cross-platform mobile, web, chat, and wearable apps, leveraging a secure and performant backend, from a shared JavaScript-based codebase."*

Let's break down that sentence quickly:

- **"Professional Developers"** - Kinvey Studio is not geared towards the "citizen developer". This is a tool that increases productivity (and generates code), but in a developer-friendly manner. All files are stored locally, and freely editable in your IDE of choice.
- **"Cross-Platform"** - Kinvey Studio focuses on creating less code, and creating it for virtually any screen size and platform.
- **"Mobile/Web/Chat/Wearable"** - And yes, this means creating cross-device experiences, enabling you to meet your customers where they are, not where you want them to be.
- **"Shared Codebase"**: Apps built with Kinvey Studio utilize modern code sharing strategies across platforms, including a common shared backend.

## Built on Solid Foundations

With a name like "Kinvey Studio", it should be no surprise that the tool itself relies on the mature foundations provided by the [Progress Kinvey](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/) serverless backend. But the tool itself goes far beyond the backend and builds upon on a variety of mature and performant libraries and frameworks. For instance:

- Native mobile apps are built on top of [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) (of course!)
- Responsive web apps and PWAs are built with components from [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui)
- Chatbots are created with [Kinvey Chat](https://www.progress.com/kinvey/chat)
