# Top 5 Kinvey Features Developers Adore - Part Two: Mobile Identity Connect

Helping developers to be successful with our products is a core component of the Developer Relations life here at Progress. Every tool we offer - from OpenEdge, to Sitefinity, to Telerik UI, to Kendo UI, to NativeScript - each is focused on developer productivity.

Let's add Progress Kinvey to that mix! Kinvey adds significant value to the backend, just as our UI suites add value to the front end. Kinvey provides a secure, robust, performant serverless platform on which developers can create more engaging systems. This leads to more engaging apps, with increased customer satisfaction and retention.

In this five-part blog series, we will look at some specific features of Kinvey that our marketing materials may normally overlook. That's because these features appeal directly to the developer, the user of Kinvey (which, as we know, is not always the buyer, right enterprise developers!).

- Part Two: Kinvey Studio
- Part Three: Mobile Identity Connect
- Part Four: Data Connectors + SDKs
- Part Five: Kinvey Chat

Today we are going to focus on the low code, but high control features provided by Kinvey Studio. Low code? High control? Let's first dive into those terms.






Almost every application includes some form of authentication—whether it is a greenfield project that can include authentication from scratch or one that must authenticate against an existing system. Both of these can be a pain to build, but the latter can lead to levels of anger and frustration that may have unforeseen consequences.

Kinvey does offer a number of built-in features that can help with building out a greenfield authentication for your app. Many of these I discussed in my tutorial on understanding users in Kinvey. These can save you time and effort when developing your app.

More importantly, however, Kinvey's Mobile Identity Connect can simplify the process of connecting to common enterprise authentication systems including Active Directory, OAuth2, SAML, LDAP and OpenID.

And, if you are building a mobile app with NativeScript, we've made adding authentication using Mobile Identity Connect even easier with NativeScript Sidekick. Using Sidekick's new enterprise authentication template, it becomes even easier to build and configure enterprise authentication in your mobile app—Sidekick will even create the necessary Mobile Identity Connect services in Kinvey for you.
