# Progress Blog: Meet the JavaScript Experts at jsMobileConf

For years Progress has been at the forefront of cutting edge JavaScript tech. When you think of the web you think [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui). When you think of native mobility you think [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/). When you think serverless you think [Progress Kinvey](https://www.progress.com/kinvey).

This is why Progress is pleased to be sponsoring jsMobileConf again this fall in Boston, MA! [jsMobileConf](https://jsmobileconf.com/) is a two-day, two-track, event focused on all things JavaScript (*including* Kendo UI, NativeScript, and Kinvey!).

But jsMobileConf is far more than Progress. With jsMobileConf we are putting on a show that encompasses *more* of the JavaScript ecosystem:

- Native Mobile Apps and PWAs
- Machine Learning
- Chatbots
- Serverless
- AR and VR
- Artificial Intelligence

> jsMobileConf will be held on November 12th and 13th in Boston, MA. Skip the details and check out [jsMobileConf.com](https://jsmobileconf.com/) for speakers, sessions, and pre-conference workshop info.

Come and meet some of the leading voices in the JavaScript community - including the best from the Progress Developer Relations team and our favorite community experts.
