# Introducing the Blues Wireless Swan

*The Swan is the most extensible Feather-compatible MCU on the market today.*

Here at Blues Wireless, we are committed to accelerating your IoT journey by offering products and services that fill the gap where projects traditionally stall or fail completely.

Case in point, the [Notecard](/products/) provides cost-effective and low-power cellular connectivity for global IoT solutions, of all shapes and sizes.

Whether you're a hobbyist spinning up a fun backyard project or a business looking to scale with cellular, the Notecard is an equally valid solution. The same goes with providing that "last mile" of cloud connectivity with [Notehub.io](/services/). With Notehub.io you can securely route sensor data from the Notecard to your cloud application of choice.

But "filling the gap" can also mean providing products and services that extend *beyond* what you likely think of as our core product set, that likely being cellular communications!

## Introducing the Swan

Today is a big day for Blues Wireless, as we are proud to introduce the **most extensible Feather-compatible MCU** on the market: the [Blues Wireless Swan](product LP).

IMAGE OF SWAN

Based on the STM32 from STMicroelectronics, the Swan works like any other Feather-compatible board available today, with these key additions:

1. It's a Feather board that can expand to **leverage 64 pins** on the core MCU.
2. It ships with built-in support for **C/C++, Arduino, and CircuitPython**.
3. It provides built-in support for the Notecard and **easy DFU** via Notehub.io.

## The Swan Notecarriers

We are also making it easy to use the Swan and Notecard together with two new Notecarrier options:

- The [Notecarrier-AF Swan Kit](shop.blues) includes a Notecarrier-AF with a pre-seated Swan and pre-soldered headers.
- The [Swan + Notecarrier-A](shop.blues) includes the bare MCU without headers and a base Notecarrier board.

These allow for seamless access of the Swan feature set, along with the traditional Notecard integration you've come to expect from our line of [Notecarriers](https://shop.blues.io/collections/notecarrier).

## Available Today

[Available now for $25](shop.blues), we're excited to see what you build with the Swan!
