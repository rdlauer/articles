# Five Considerations when Building Battery-Efficient IoT Solutions

It goes without saying (yet I'm going to say it anyway) that the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way we interact with devices and collect data. As IoT devices continue to proliferate in various industries (such as agriculture, remote healthcare, transportation/logistics, just to name a few), energy efficiency becomes a critical concern. IoT devices often rely on batteries for power, and optimizing battery life is essential for maintaining performance and reducing long-term maintenance costs.

In this article, we will take a high-level look at five considerations for building battery-efficient IoT products. These are targeted at IoT developers, embedded engineers, and product designers looking to build IoT devices that consume minimal energy while still delivering optimal performance.

## Choose the Right Hardware Components

While it may seem obvious, power-consumption is not always the first consideration we think of when sourcing components.

Components such as microcontrollers, sensors, and communication modules all contribute to overall power consumption. Consider the following when choosing your hardware:

- **Low-power microcontrollers:** You know microcontrollers as the brains of IoT devices, so selecting a low-power microcontroller is crucial. Choose microcontrollers that offer sleep modes and other power-saving features. For example, the Blues Swan is...
- **Efficient sensors:** Sensors consume power while measuring and transmitting data. Opt for sensors with lower power consumption and a short response time. You should also consider the sensor's operating voltage, as lower voltages can help save energy.
Optimized communication modules: Communication modules consume power during data transmission and reception. Select modules that offer power-saving features such as sleep mode, low standby current, and low transmit/receive current. Examples of low-power communication modules include LoRa, Zigbee, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
2. Optimize Software for Energy Efficiency
Software plays a crucial role in determining the power consumption of IoT devices. Optimizing the software can significantly reduce energy consumption, thus extending battery life. Here are some tips for optimizing software:
Use power-saving modes: Take advantage of the power-saving modes offered by your microcontroller. These may include deep sleep, sleep, and idle modes. Use these modes to minimize power consumption during periods of inactivity.
Optimize sensor data collection: Sensors should only be active when necessary. Schedule sensor data collection to occur at specific intervals, and put the sensor to sleep when not in use. You can also use adaptive sampling rates based on the device's operating conditions.
Reduce data transmission frequency: Minimize the frequency of data transmission to save power. This can be done by transmitting only when significant changes in sensor data occur or by aggregating data and transmitting it in larger packets less frequently.
Optimize communication protocols: Choose communication protocols that are optimized for low-power consumption. For example, MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for IoT devices with limited resources. It can help reduce power consumption by minimizing the amount of data transmitted between devices.
3. Utilize Energy Harvesting Techniques
Energy harvesting techniques can help supplement battery power by converting ambient energy sources into usable electrical energy. Some common energy harvesting techniques include:
Solar power: Solar cells can convert sunlight into electricity, providing an excellent power source for IoT devices in outdoor environments. Choose solar cells with high conversion efficiency and a suitable output voltage for your device.
Thermoelectric generators: These devices generate electricity by exploiting the temperature difference between two materials. They can be used to power IoT devices in environments with varying temperature gradients, such as industrial settings or near HVAC systems.
Vibration energy harvesting: Piezoelectric materials can convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy. These can be used to power IoT devices in environments with constant vibrations, such as machinery or vehicles.
Implementing energy harvesting techniques can help extend battery life and reduce the need for frequent battery replacements.
Design for Efficient Power Management
A well-designed power management system can significantly improve the battery life of your IoT device. Consider implementing the following power management strategies:
Voltage regulation: Using efficient voltage regulators can help minimize power losses during voltage conversion. Choose low-dropout regulators (LDOs) or switching regulators with high conversion efficiency and low quiescent current to minimize power consumption.
Battery selection and monitoring: Choose the right battery type for your IoT device based on factors such as energy density, discharge characteristics, and self-discharge rate. Additionally, implement battery monitoring techniques to ensure the device operates within the safe voltage range and to detect when the battery needs replacement.
Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS): DVS allows the microcontroller to operate at different voltage levels depending on the computational load. Implementing DVS can help reduce power consumption by lowering the voltage during periods of low computational demand.
Load shedding: Load shedding involves turning off non-essential components when they are not in use. This can help conserve battery power by minimizing unnecessary energy consumption.
5. Perform Rigorous Power Testing and Analysis
Testing and analyzing the power consumption of your IoT device can help identify areas for optimization and ensure that your device meets energy efficiency targets. Consider the following power testing and analysis tips:
Power profiling: Measure the power consumption of your device during different operating conditions, such as idle, active, and sleep modes. This can help you identify power-hungry components and optimize their operation.
Battery life estimation: Estimate the battery life of your IoT device by calculating its average power consumption and comparing it to the battery capacity. This can help you set realistic expectations for battery life and make necessary design adjustments.
Power optimization tools: Use power optimization tools, such as EnergyTrace (for Texas Instruments devices) or STM32CubeMonitor-Power (for STMicroelectronics devices), to analyze power consumption and identify areas for improvement.
Field testing: Perform field tests to ensure that your IoT device operates efficiently in real-world conditions. This can help you identify any unforeseen power issues that may not be apparent during lab testing.
By following these five tips, you can build battery-efficient IoT devices that offer extended battery life, reduced maintenance costs, and improved performance. By selecting the right hardware components, optimizing software, utilizing energy harvesting techniques, designing efficient power management systems, and conducting thorough power testing and analysis, you can create IoT devices that consume minimal energy while still delivering the features and functionality your users need.
In conclusion, the key to building battery-efficient IoT products lies in careful component selection, software optimization, and thorough testing. By following these guidelines, developers and engineers can create IoT devices that offer both optimal performance and extended battery life, thus reducing the need for frequent battery replacements and minimizing maintenance costs.
