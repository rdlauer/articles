# Global Cellular/GPS Asset Tracking for Dummies

*Learn how to build a low-cost and low-code asset tracking solution with global cellular and GPS.*

One of the more intriguing use cases to be born out of the IoT is the ability to actively monitor the location and condition of, well, *anything*. Whether you are monitoring the temperature, humidity, and fall detection of a critical vaccine shipment or tracking your location on a cross-country road trip, using off-the-shelf sensors with cellular and GPS modules has made asset tracking easier than ever.

But what if you don't know where to start? Or what if you don't want to invest serious ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° in a fully decked-out tracker?

In [this Hackster tutorial](), I built a low-cost (< $100 USD) cellular- and GPS-enabled tracking system and sent it, literally, around the world to almost every continent. I tracked its location with a cloud-based dashboard from Ubidots, and even updated some settings on the trackers themselves **after** I had sent them on their journey.
