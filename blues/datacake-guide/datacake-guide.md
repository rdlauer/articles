# Visualizing the IoT with Datacake and the Blues Wireless Notecard

*Datacake is a low-code IoT platform that seamlessly integrates with Notehub.io. Learn more about how to rout Notecard data to Datacake.*

The wave of self-described "low code" development solutions has come (and mostly gone) without much fanfare. While there have been some successes, generally speaking, **developers require control above any desire to cut corners**.

We now know the best low code solutions do enough to get you 70% of the way there, but also provide that bare metal access to customize the last 30% of your project.

This is where the intersection of the [Blues Wireless Notecard](https://blues.io/products/) and the low code IoT platform [Datacake](https://datacake.co/low-code-iot-platform) come in.

## What is Datacake?

The Datacake website does a fantastic job of describing what the platform is, at a high level:

> Datacake is a multi-purpose, low-code IoT platform that requires no programming skills and minimal time to create custom IoT applications that can be brought into a white label IoT solution at the push of a button.

In practice, Datacake lets you take that IoT sensor data you've been accumulating, and turn it into engaging data dashboards.

These dashboard reports are created in a straightforward point-and-click manner, with little coding required.

## What is the Blues Wireless Notecard?

The Notecard is a cellular and GPS device-to-cloud data-pump that comes with 500 MB of data and 10 years of pre-paid cellular service for $49. No activation charges, no monthly fees.

The Notecard SoM measures 30mm x 34mm and is ready to embed in a project via an M.2 connector. But to make prototyping a snap, the Notecard can utilize a host [Notecarrier expansion board](https://blues.io/products/#notecarrier) for usage with **virtually any MCU or single-board computer**.

The Notecard also speaks JSON. It's every developer's dream, whether you program regularly in Python, Arduino, C, C++ or any other language that can read/write JSON!

## Route Data from Notecard to Datacake

The path of data from the Notecard to your cloud application takes a journey like:

1. Your MCU or SBC **gathers** sensor data;
2. The Notecard **delivers** it to [Notehub.io](https://blues.io/services/);
3. Notehub.io **securely relays** the data to your cloud provider (e.g. Datacake, AWS, Azure, etc).

"Secure" is a key word for the Notecard. With an integrated [STSAFE Secure Element](https://www.st.com/en/secure-mcus/stsafe-a100.html) with hardware crypto, true hardware random number generator, and a factory-installed ECC P-384 certificate provisioned at chip manufacture, the Notecard takes security to heart.

In addition, all transactions between the Notecard and Notehub.io utilize encrypted "off the Internet" communication protocols with VPN tunneling from cellular provider direct to cloud.
